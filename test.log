I see.

> Ever since you looked at me with those big orange eyes.
How big?

Tell me more.
> Your eyes fill my conscience with a feeling of both relief and longing.
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT MY EYES FILL YOUR CONSCIENCE WITH A FEELING OF BOTH RELIEF AND LONGING 
> I am.  And I also see your bountious bosom.
DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS NORMAL TO BE  AND YOU ALSO SEE MY BOUNTIOUS BOSOM 
> Bosom!
That is quite interesting.

HAVE YOU ALWAYS ENJOYED A COW

Moo!

We're discussing you-- not me.

Please continue.

Tell me more about such feelings.
> It's a feeling deep in your soul!
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN SOUL 
> Once it was half, now it's whole.  A side of beef, if you will.
I could really go for a hamburger right now.
